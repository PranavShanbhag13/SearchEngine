A Java-based search engine utilizes Apache Tomcat, Java Servlets, MySQL, Jsoup, a custom web crawler, JDBC, and an indexer to provide efficient web search capabilities. It fetches, indexes, and retrieves web content, displaying the top 30 relevant search results. This project showcases robust web scraping, indexing, and search functionalities.<br>
Features<br>
Web Crawling: Built with Jsoup, our custom web crawler fetches web pages, extracts data, and stores it for indexing.<br>
Indexing: The indexer processes crawled data and creates an efficient search index for quick retrieval.<br>
Search Functionality: Users can input search queries to find relevant web pages, with results ranked and displayed.<br>
Database Integration: All data is stored in a MySQL database, accessed via JDBC for efficient data management.<br>
Java Servlets: The backend logic is handled by Java Servlets, ensuring smooth handling of search queries and results.<br>
Apache Tomcat: The project is deployed on an Apache Tomcat server, providing a robust and scalable environment.<br>
Technologies Used<br>
Apache Tomcat: For deploying and running the web application.<br>
Java Servlets: For handling HTTP requests and responses.<br>
MySQL: As the database management system to store crawled data and search indices.<br>
Jsoup: For web scraping and parsing HTML.<br>
Custom Web Crawler: To systematically browse the web and fetch data for indexing.<br>
JDBC: For database connectivity and operations.<br>
Indexer: To create and manage search indices for fast retrieval of search results.<br>
